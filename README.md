Library Project

It is a maven project so you can import and run it in any IDE (I have developed it on Eclipse).
I have implemented all requirements. I have worked with MySQL database. There is a database.properties file where I put any necessary things to connect with database (password, link etc). In SQLFilesToStart folder I put *.sql files (I have worked and tested application on these data).
To test application I was using a LibraryCrudTest class with main method, where I was calling methods with printing in console the results. There are this code as comments.
